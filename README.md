paping railing on python
-------------------------

This program essentially pings the host and checks the RTT and if there is time out error, it warns user via various ways
such as text output, e-mailing, showing on the console.<br/> 
All of the data can be written during run-time to a .csv file wrt to the time when ping test conducted. <br/>
If a certain amount of time out errors are achieved then program emails to the user. <br/>
The software uses paping.exe to accomplish the task. Currently, paping can only ping TCP ports. <br/>
WireShark reports the typical TCP packet size is 66 bytes or 528 bits. <br/>
