paping railing on python
-------------------------

This is a very poorly written python code that makes the job done. <br/>
It essentially pings the host and checks the RTT and if there is time out error. <br/>
All of the data is written later to a .csv file wrt to the time when ping test conducted. <br/>
If a certain amount of time out errors are achieved then program emails to the user. <br/>
The software uses paping.exe to accomplish the task. Currently, paping can only ping TCP ports. <br/>
WireShark reports the typical TCP packet size is 66 bytes or 528 bits. <br/>

paping can be downloaded from here:<br/>

Personally suggesting to get x86 version.<br/>
